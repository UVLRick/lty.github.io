About Me
======
Greetings! My name is Tengyue Li (Chinese: 李腾跃). I am a Ph.D. candidate supervised by [Prof. Bo He](http://it.ouc.edu.cn/2019/0529/c16095a248941/page.htm) at the [Underwater Vehicle Lab, Intelligent Perception & Machine Learning Lab](http://www.ouc-uvl.org/) in the School of Information Science and Engineering, Ocean University of China (OUC). I am funded by the Joint Ph.D. Scholarship Programme of Ocean University of China to carry out my research as a visiting scholar in the School of Informatics, University of Leicester (UoL). My research work in the UK will be carried out under the guidance of [Prof. Huiyu Zhou](https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/informatics/people/huiyu-zhou). Previously, I served as an hardware engineer in Hisense, focusing on the research and development of optical communication modules for high performance computers. I received my M.Sc. in Optical Engineering from OUC in 2015, my B.Eng. in Electrical Information Science and Technology from OUC in 2013. 

Currently, I am focusing on image processing, computer vision, and machine learning, especially in underwater image analysis for an underwater robotics platform (e.g., autonomous underwater vehicles and remotely operated vehicles).
